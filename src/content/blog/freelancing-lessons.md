A year ago, I made the leap from full-time employment to freelance software development. Here's what I've learned along the way.

## Finding Your First Clients

The hardest part of freelancing is getting started. My first clients came from three sources:

1. **Former colleagues** who moved to companies that needed development help
2. **Open source contributions** that showcased my skills to potential clients
3. **Content creation** — blog posts and technical articles that established credibility

## Pricing Strategy

I initially undercharged because I was afraid of losing projects. Here's what I learned:

- **Value-based pricing** beats hourly rates for both you and the client
- **Always include a discovery phase** — it helps you scope the project accurately
- **Don't compete on price** — compete on quality and reliability

## Communication Is Everything

Technical skills get you in the door, but communication skills keep clients coming back:

- Send weekly status updates, even when things are going smoothly
- Be transparent about challenges and delays
- Document everything — decisions, requirements, and changes

## Work-Life Balance

The freedom of freelancing can be a double-edged sword:

- Set clear working hours and communicate them to clients
- Learn to say no to projects that don't align with your goals
- Take vacations — your business won't collapse if you step away for a week

## Conclusion

Freelancing has been one of the most rewarding decisions of my career. It's not always easy, but the autonomy and variety make it worth the challenges.
